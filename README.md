# systems-installs

Common linux setup for any server/system that we manage. This repository
represents 'infrastructure as code' and changes to this code will be
executed against production after each merge.

## Common Server Setup here and just the common server setup

We do not seek to configure the full system here, just common elements to get
a server ready for further customization. 

## Things to install as common setup

- admin users (grants server access)
- security configurations
- OS level details, like security, common logging configs, unattended upgrades, etc..
